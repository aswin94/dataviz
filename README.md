## This is a data visualization sample done using React.js and react-viz (by Uber).
## I have used github data to visualize the trend of Pull-request, for a programming language, over a period of time.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
